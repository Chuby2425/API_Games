  <p>We are a passionate independent gaming group that loves playing video games, discussing them,
    and sharing our experiences with others. We believe that gaming is more than just entertainment
    - itâ€™s a way of life!
  </p>
  <p>Our journey began when we discovered the RAW.io API and realized the potential it had to offer.
    We saw an opportunity to create a platform where we could not only showcase our love for gaming,
    but also provide a space for others to do the same.
  </p>
  <p>With hard work, dedication, and a lot of coffee, we created Games Catalog using RAW.io - a platform for gamers by gamers.
    Our goal is to create a community of like-minded individuals who share our passion for gaming and who want
    to connect with others who feel the same.
